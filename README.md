# Advent-of-Code-2022

"Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware."

In this repository you will be able to find my proposed solution for the twenty-four tasks of 2022. The input for each of the days is separated by a txt file with the indication "Input_" and the day. The resolution is duly commented in a file called "main".

Suggestions or proposals for improvement are always welcome!
